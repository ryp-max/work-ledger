## Grain

The first week of the year always feels like opening a fresh notebook. There's something meditative about setting up a new project—choosing the right tools, establishing patterns, creating space for future work.

I wanted this ledger to feel calm and intentional. Not another productivity app shouting for attention, but a quiet corner for reflection. The Japanese concept of *kanso* (simplicity) guided many decisions: muted colors, generous whitespace, restrained motion.

The hardest part was resisting the urge to add more features. A good ledger doesn't need bells and whistles—it needs good paper and a reliable binding.
