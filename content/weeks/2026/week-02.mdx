## Grain

This week was about establishing the visual vocabulary. Every design system needs a few core elements that can be combined in different ways. For the ledger, these are:

1. **Paper** — the warm off-white background that everything sits on
2. **Ink** — the charcoal text that carries meaning
3. **Stamp** — the muted red accent for status and emphasis
4. **Tape** — the beige chips and backgrounds for metadata

The link tape chips were particularly satisfying to build. They're inspired by those old-school label makers—functional, tactile, a little nostalgic. Each link type gets its own subtle color variation, but they all feel like they belong to the same family.

Sometimes constraints are gifts. Working within a limited palette forces creative solutions.
