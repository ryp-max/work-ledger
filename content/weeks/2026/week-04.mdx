## Grain

Week four brings a shift in focus. The foundational work is largely complete—now it's time to explore what this ledger can become.

The node graph research is fascinating. There's something deeply satisfying about visual programming interfaces when they're done well. The challenge is always the same: how do you balance power with simplicity? Too many options and the interface becomes overwhelming. Too few and it can't express complex ideas.

I've been thinking about how the ledger itself is a kind of node graph. Each week connects to projects (tags), which connect to other weeks. The sidebar is a flattened view of this graph. What if we could visualize these connections differently?

For now, the current structure serves its purpose. But the seeds of something more are planted.

## Notes

Remember to add placeholder images for the artifacts section. The grid looks better with actual content.
